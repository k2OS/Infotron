""" 
Handles input from huge buttons attached to GPIO-pins on the Infotron RPi
More details on the project here: https://github.com/k2OS/Infotron

based on rpi-gpio-kbrd.py by Chris Swan 9 Aug 2012
requires uinput kernel module (sudo modprobe uinput)
requires python-uinput (git clone https://github.com/tuomasjjrasanen/python-uinput)
requires RPI.GIO (from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO/0.3.1a)

DESCRIPTION
- master timer needed to control if the monÃ­tor should be turned off (say.. 2 minutes after inactivity)
  - when timeout is reached, send key event to JS to reset to default slide/screen
- back/forwards 'buttons' to 'navigate' (captured by JS - turns monitor on as well and navigates current slidehow)
 - on/toggle button to turn on the monitor and then control which slideshow is viewed (captured by JS)
 - one output to control a relay (for turning monitor on and off) - set to pin 12 (board-mode) for now 
 - maybe an additional output to control a little light.. (monitor etc. could be turned on/off with a single common output)

Pins are taken from here: 
http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/image/data/tutorial/raspberry-pi/gpio-pinout.jpg

NOTE: There is a difference between the board made and the pin layout below 
- the pin layout has to be changed!!!!
